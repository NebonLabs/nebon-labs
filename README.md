# 🔮 Nebon Labs – Illusion Engine

> _Reality is what you make it._

This repository contains foundational research, system architecture, and early-stage prototypes for building the Nebon universe — a Web3-powered alternate reality where NFTs come to life and interact with users and each other.

We're exploring the boundaries between digital ownership, emergent behavior, and social immersion in decentralized environments.
